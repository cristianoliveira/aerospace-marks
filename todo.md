# FIX/ALIGN: Sway marks are uniq
---
Each identifier can only be 
set on a single window at a time since they act as a unique identifier
---

# TEST: create a way to test failed commands (exit 1)

# FEAT: mark stores window id and window name. Allow to focus by name as fallback

# FIX(list): cmd doesnt print multiple marks when window has more than one mark

# CHORE(CI): adds release-please config file and workflow
